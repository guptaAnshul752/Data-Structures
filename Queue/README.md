# Queues

Queues are a type of container adaptors which operate in a first in first out (FIFO) type of arrangement. 
Elements are inserted at the back (end) and are deleted from the front. 
Queues use an encapsulated object of deque or list (sequential container class) as its underlying container, providing a specific set of member functions to access its elements.

## Operations on Queue:
Mainly the following four basic operations are performed on queue:

- Enqueue: Adds an item to the queue. If the queue is full, then it is said to be an Overflow condition.
- Dequeue: Removes an item from the queue. The items are popped in the same order in which they are pushed. If the queue is empty, then it is said to be an Underflow condition.
- Front: Get the front item from queue.
- Rear: Get the last item from queue.

## Queues Implementation

Queues can be implemented by using following Data Structures

- Arrays
- Linked List
