# Priority Queues

Priority Queue is an extension of queue with following properties.

- Every item has a priority associated with it.
- An element with high priority is dequeued before an element with low priority.
- If two elements have the same priority, they are served according to their order in the queue.

## Applications of Priority Queue:

1) CPU Scheduling
2) Graph algorithms like Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm, Prim’s Minimum Spanning Tree, etc
3) All queue applications where priority is involved.
